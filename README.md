# uxplay-windows: UxPlay AirPlay-Mirror and AirPlay-Audio for Windows

This project is provides binary builds of UxPlay and Github Actions to compile the code, since the [original project](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/) 
just provides source code and instruction on how to compile everything. Here you can just download the software without the hassle of compiling it.

This project uses the code from [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to compile, an icon from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) and [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to create the installer.

In this repo you should only report issues related to the build system I made on the github action, and in the respective places issues related to other
parts of this software

If you want to use this project for anything please see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
